## Overview
Firstly, commit regularly. 
Every commit is its own "solution to a self contained problem". In your commit message, simply explain the problem that you fixed, Or feature that you implemented.

# git
1. Install git in the custom theme directory
2. Commit your theme development to PixelStorm beanstalk repo, excluding the node_modules folder
3. (Optional) Checkout a local feature branch when working on a new feature and merge into master when you are done.
4. Deploy your master branch through beanstalk
